        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">15 hours free childcare for 3 and 4-year-olds</h1>

        <p>All 3 to 4-year-olds in England can get 570 free hours per year. It’s usually taken as 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year, but you can choose to take fewer hours over more weeks, for example. </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            Some 3 to 4-year-olds are eligible for 30 hours free childcare a week. <a href="#">Check if you’re eligible and find out how to apply</a>.
        </div>

        <p>The free early education and childcare:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>must be with an <a href="/round-2/help-with-childcare-costs">approved childcare provider</a></li>
            <li>stops when your child starts in reception class (or reaches compulsory school age, if later)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You may have to pay for extra costs like meals, nappies or trips.</p>

        <p>You can get it from the term after your child’s 3rd birthday.</p>

        <p>Contact your childcare provider or local council to find out more.</p>
