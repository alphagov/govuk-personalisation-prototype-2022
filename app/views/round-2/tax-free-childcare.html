        <p>You can get up to £500 every 3 months (up to £2,000 a year) for each of your children to help with the costs of childcare. This goes up to £1,000 every 3 months if a child is disabled (up to £4,000 a year).</p>

        <p>If you get Tax-Free Childcare, you’ll set up an online childcare account for your child. For every £8 you pay into this account, the government will pay in £2 to use to pay your provider.</p>

        <p>You can get Tax-Free Childcare at the same time as 30 hours free childcare if you’re eligible for both.</p>

            <li>childminders, nurseries and nannies</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Your childcare provider must be signed up to the scheme before you can pay them and benefit from Tax-Free Childcare.</p>

        <p>Check with your provider to see if they’re signed up.</p>

            <li>if you are working</li>
            <li>your income (and your partner’s income, if you have one)</li>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="if-you-are-working">If you are working</h3>
        <p>You can usually get Tax-Free Childcare if you (and your partner, if you have one) are:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>in work</li>

        <p>If you’re on adoption leave, you cannot apply for the child you’re on leave for unless you’re going back to work within 31 days of the date you first applied.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="if-your-working-pattern-has-changed-because-of-coronavirus-covid-19">If your working pattern has changed because of coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

        <p>You may still be eligible for Tax-Free Childcare if you’re temporarily working less and either:</p>

        <p>You may still be eligible if your partner is working, and you get Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, Carer’s Allowance or contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="your-income">Your income</h3>
        <p>You’ll need to expect to earn a certain amount over the next 3 months. This is at least the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage or Living Wage</a> for 16 hours a week on average.</p>

        <p>For example, over the next 3 months you expect to earn at least £1,853.28 - the National Living Wage for people over 23.</p>

        <p>If you have a partner, they’ll need to expect to earn at least this much too.</p>

        <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
            <p>If you or your partner are temporarily earning less than this amount because of coronavirus, you may still be eligible. You must be furloughed through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme or claiming a Self Employment Income Support Scheme grant to qualify.</p>

        <p>If you’re self-employed and do not expect to make enough profit in the next 3 months, you can use an average of how much you expect to make over the current tax year.</p>

        <p>This earnings limit does not apply if you’re self-employed and started your business less than 12 months ago.</p>

        <p>If you or your partner have an expected ‘adjusted net income’ over £100,000 in the current tax year you will not be eligible. This includes any bonuses you expect to get.</p>

        <p>Your adjusted net income is your total <a href="/guidance/adjusted-net-income">taxable income</a> before any personal allowances and minus things like Gift Aid.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="your-child">Your child</h3>

        <p>Your child must be 11 or under and usually live with you. They stop being eligible on 1 September after their 11th birthday.</p>

        <p>Adopted children are eligible, but foster children are not.</p>

        <p>If your child is disabled you may get up to £4,000 a year until they’re 17. They’re eligible for this if they:</p>

        <p>If you’re living in an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you (or your partner if you have one) might still be eligible for Tax-Free Childcare if:</p>
