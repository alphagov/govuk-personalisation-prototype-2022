            <p>Penny and her husband got married last year and are soon to be expecting a baby. It is their first child so they’re not sure of the order in which they need to put things in place and what they are eligible for.</p>

            <p>They currently live in the city but have decided that it is too hectic for a life with a newborn. They are ready to buy their first home together and have decided to do so outside of the city. Penny also realises that this means she will need to learn how to drive as amenities will no longer be on her doorstep like they are now in the city. </p>

            <p>Moving to a new area means she will have to quit her job, and she isn’t sure when she will be going back to work after their baby is born so she needs to find out what support she and her husband can get throughout that period. </p>
