Maybe some of the cons - I mean some people might see it as this is the government’s back way of spying on us all and seeing you know I’m not one of those people but I can see some people would say well why do they need all this data this is my data sort of thing what are they actually using it for and I could see that that could be a downside to it but for me the positives are that I’m able to share that data all in one place and it’s easily managed as well. And I’ve still got control of how much of that is shared as well. </p>

            <p>Generally speaking, users reacted positively to the concept of the GOV.UK account as part of a x-gov transaction, however, there were various comments around its usefulness being dependent on whether or not there was a genuine reason to use it. </p>

            <p>Users also expected that if they entered data to a GOV.UK account, this data would be shared across all government services. This upholds findings from previous rounds of user research carried out by GOV.UK teams. </p>
            <p>As a team, we refer to this idea of data sharing as <a href="../features/08.html"> ‘global push’</a>. That is, if a user adds, amends or deletes data, it will automatically be updated, or ‘pushed’, across the account and relevant government services.</p>

            <p>The expectation that ‘global push’ occurs, was a recurring theme throughout our user research sessions, and one that presents a risk in terms of human impact due to the gap between that expectation and reality.</p>

            <p> If users engage in a transaction and believe that the data has been pushed and processed by all relevant services, when in reality that is not the case, the outcome could be detrimental - particularly in scenarios relating to benefits and eligibility.</p>

So for me, that would probably be what I’d do, just to make it a little bit easier when I come to it, instead of having to delete what’s already in there. But if I was in like a job where I get paid the same amount every week or every month and my hours didn’t change, then I’d be quite happy to save all my details on there for next time.</p>

So, it’s quite good that they give you the option because, I mean, each person’s different; some people will be happy for all the information to be stored, some people wouldn’t want any information storing at all. So the fact that that actually gives you the option to save all of your information, or some of your information, or none at all, I think that’s quite good. Because it gives everybody the opportunity then, of their preferences.</p>
