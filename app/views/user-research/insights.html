Maybe some of the cons - I mean some people might see it as this is the government’s back way of spying on us all and seeing you know I’m not one of those people but I can see some people would say well why do they need all this data this is my data sort of thing what are they actually using it for and I could see that that could be a downside to it but for me the positives are that I’m able to share that data all in one place and it’s easily managed as well. And I’ve still got control of how much of that is shared as well. </p>

    <p>As part of a cross-team exercise, we asked users about their perspective on data storage.</p>
    <p>As expected, the average citizen will not be able to articulate preferences around storage. They do, however, reference security.</p>

    <p> The reason for posing this question in research, is that there has been some discussion in the programme about the use of solid PODS.</p>

    <p>Whilst this work is now being owned by another team, we recommended that the following end user issues be considered:</p>

        <li>Whether control and ownership over data is a positive thing for citizens - We recommend an impact assessment to better understand worse case scenarios.</li>
        <li>Whether PODS would entail any transfer of responsibility to users, and if so, what risks and concerns could that cause for citizen users.</li>
        <li>Do PODS meet user needs?</li>
