    <p>A recurring piece of feedback was the usefulness of having <b>everything in one place</b>. </p>

    <p>Users also commented on:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Time saving </li>
        <li>A consistent, easy and efficient way of dealing with the government</li>
        <li>One login for everything</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>N.B. we were testing a concept that we had designed for user research, the GOV.UK account does not exist with such a full range of functionality in real life. </i></p>

    <p>Generally speaking, users reacted positively to the concept of the GOV.UK account as part of a x-gov transaction, however, there were various comments around its usefulness being dependent on whether or not there was a genuine reason to use it. </p>

    <p>Comments in user research highlighted the fact that throughout certain periods of life (i.e. childcare) the likelihood of interacting with government services is much higher.</p>

    <p>For some, depending on lifestyle, the regularity of interactions with the government is much lower. Some users clearly articulated that they would find the account useful ‘now’ (during childcare) whereas otherwise they may not see the point. </p>

    <p>Further work around profile raising and adoption of the account will likely be needed in the future to understand how best to compel users to create an account and engage with its features. </p>

    <p>There will be some data sceptics within the future audience who will be unlikely to save data to a GOV.UK account. This project does not seek to quantify or predict this potential segment. </p>

    <p>Some users commented that they thought the information would be used for demographic analysis </p>

    <p>A small number of users were concerned about the data that the government was gathering about them, with a concern that it would be used against them one day. </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>we asked users to consent to save individual items of data to their GOV.UK account</li>
                <li>We then asked users to consent before this was used in a transactional form</li>
                <li>Users reacted positively to this level of management</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We also iterated on the <a href="../features/03.html">dashboard</a> options for the <a href="../features/21.html">management of data</a> </li>
        <li>We iterated on ideas around <a href="../features/17.html">audit trail</a> which were also well received </li>
        <li>We indicated at a page and paragraph level where data was being used for <a href="../features/04.html"> curated content and personalisation</a> </li>
        <li>We explored options around <a href="../features/10.html">global controls</a> in a ‘settings’ area of the account</li>

    <p>In our concept exploration, users expected that data saved to their GOV.UK account would be <a href="../features/08.html">‘pushed’</a> to the services they interact with. </p>
    <p>When this was raised during user research we explored why.<br /> We heard answers such as:</p>
    <br />
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>“Because I’m logged into the GOV.UK website” </i></p>
        <p><i>“Because it’s all within government”</i> </p>
        <p><i>“Because digital things are connected”</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    <p>This supplements and supports the original discovery research within the GOV.UK accounts programme which took place in 2019. </p>
    <p>One assumption is that the naming of the GOV.UK account - which is the same name as the GOV.UK website, could be manifesting this misconception.</p>

    <p>As part of a cross-team exercise, we asked users about their perspective on data storage.</p>
    <p>As expected, the average citizen will not be able to articulate preferences around storage. They do, however, reference security.</p>

    <p> The reason for posing this question in research, is that there has been some discussion in the programme about the use of solid PODS.</p>
    <p>Whilst this work is now being owned by another team, we recommended that the following end user issues be considered:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Whether control and ownership over data is a positive thing for citizens - We recommend an impact assessment to better understand worse case scenarios.</li>
        <li>Whether PODS would entail any transfer of responsibility to users, and if so, what risks and concerns could that cause for citizen users.</li>
        <li>Do PODS meet user needs?</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Whilst some users said that this would help in the sense that it would make life easier, some users expressed concerns over accuracy. </p>

    <p> Comments around accuracy generally related to benefit payments and there was a concern that if fully automated transactions are inaccurate, then it could impact their monthly benefit payment, or even their eligibility to continue claiming. </p>
