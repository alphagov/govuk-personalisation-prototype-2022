<p>Services mostly reacted very positively to this feature and gave lots of examples of use cases for each of their services. Services spoke about whether documents would be automatically saved or whether the end user would have the ability to upload documents.

<p>Services expanded on the idea of saved documents and spoke of the value of having the ability to have a 'saved status' which could be shared e.g. in receipt of PIP, have a Blue Badge. </p>
