<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>"We had to stop giving renewal reminder letters as we were never sure if we had up to date details. We found people had died after sending them update reminders... There is no function as a Blue Badge department to do a yearly 'do you still live here?' - we would know that if someone went to update their driving license we would get it, if we knew from DVLA that they had died we would find out. If we knew that data is reliable then we could communicate with customers better, being safe in the knowledge that that is up to date, as reliable as needed it to be...a better form of communication. We had to get rid of reminders as it caused so much upset [reference to sending reminders to deceased Blue Badge holders]." West Northamptonshire Council - <strong>Blue Badge</strong>

   <li>"Register a death, [if this information was known] you would like that all the services are shut down" <strong>Camden LA</strong></li>
   <li>"If a new permit thing comes in to place we have no way of sending out [this information] to all customers [as unsure of whether their adress is up to date or whether they are deceased]. At the moment when we have to do a communication, we're aware it isn't going to catch a huge amount of customers." West Northamptonshire Council - <strong>Blue Badge</strong></li>
   <li>"The first thing for me is death notifications / certificates, this is a really big problem. Our service is at the bottom of the list, and the ability to tell government once would be really helpful." <strong>MOJ</strong></li>
