   <li>"We had to stop giving renewal reminder letters as we were never sure if we had up to date details. We found people had died after sending them update reminders... There is no function as a Blue Badge department to do a yearly 'do you still live here?' - we would know that if someone went to update their driving license we would get it, if we knew from DVLA that they had died we would find out. If we knew that data is reliable then we could communicate with customers better, being safe in the knowledge that that is up to date, as reliable as needed it to be...a better form of communication. We had to get rid of reminders as it caused so much upset [reference to sending reminders to deceased Blue Badge holders]." West Northamptonshire Council - <strong>Blue Badge</strong>
