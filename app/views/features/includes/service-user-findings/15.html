<p>Services saw some value in this feature, however almost all spoke about the implementation needing to be carefully considered.</p>
<p> There was concern that people would just glance over the pre-populated information and not properly check it.</p>
<p>If there was a mistake, it could cause issues. There then becomes a reliance on the user keeping their information up to date.</p>

    <p><i>We have a lot of people 'who say why do you keep asking me my address?' - if it can be pre-populated then there is a lot of value in that to save the user having to complete again." </i></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>What you pre-populate needs to be heavily considered, things that are for tax return or Universal Credit would be more risky. <br /><br />The basic stuff sounds really good, each service would have to determine where they sit on friction and ease.<br /><br />For our service we don't want users to tick tick tick through our service - [they need] to consider the questions but [it] might not be as important for another service." </i></p>
