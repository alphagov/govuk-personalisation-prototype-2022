<p>Services saw some value in this feature, however almost all spoke about the implementation needing to be carefully considered. There was concern that people would just glance over the pre-populated information and not properly check it. If there was a mistake, it could cause issues. There then becomes a reliance on the user keeping their information up to date.</p>

<p>"We have a lot of people 'who say why do you keep asking me my address?' - if it can be pre-populated then there is a lot of value in that to save the user having to complete again." <strong>Camden LA</strong></p>

<p>"What you pre-populate needs to be heavily considered, things that are for tax return or Universal Credit would be more risky. The basic stuff sounds really good, each service would have to determine where they sit on friction and ease. For our service we don't want users to tick tick tick through our service - [they need] to consider the questions but [it] might not be as important for another service." <strong>MOJ</strong></p>
