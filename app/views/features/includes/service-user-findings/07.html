<p>Notifications are important for establishing trust with users, as they know when things are happening when they're being updated.</p>

<p>This feature encourages people to engage more online and helps to reduce phone calls and emails to the service. There could be significant operational cost reductions if notifications were implemented:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>"44% of all calls are a result of progress chasing." </i></p>
    <p><strong>DWP</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>"Important for the user to give informed consent, and have the ability be able to dial it up or down, not just for the account but for an individual service."</i></p>
    <p> <strong>MOJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There needs to be careful consideration that notifications don't overwhelm users, especially if they're all coming from the GOV.UK account on behalf of different services.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>"Tax credits, working tax credits, I know a lot of people are checking up on their account with us to make sure the money they are dependent on is going to be paid, checking their banking apps to make sure they have the money to go and do their shopping...</i></p>
    <p><i>...If we could send them a notification that we've paid them that would be great." </i></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>"Citizens sometimes get paid before receiving the letter so [notifications would be] really valuable."</i></p>
    <p><strong>DWP</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>"If we can get to a stage where a citizen is due their assessment, [notifications] will make things easier. The main thing is [reference to user pain point] citizens not knowing the stages of their applications, all these things add up as pain points. 40% of calls are due to chasing the status, there is a huge financial gain for notifications."</i></p>
