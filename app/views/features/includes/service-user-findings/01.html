<p>This feature was seen as having the potential to be really useful for services across a wide range of use cases...but there was considerable concern from services about user adoption/reactions.</p>
<p><strong>How to strike the right balance between government knowing everything about the user and helping the user</strong></p>
<p>For users who don't understand what services are out there, it can help them, but from a privacy activist perspective you'll get a lot of push back. Not from individuals so much as organisations acting on individuals behalf.</p>
<p>Services have concerns that suggesting eligiblity will increase the volumes of enquiries they receive from users. Therefore, careful consideration should be taken in to account for how this feature works.</p>
<p>Suggested eligibility based on new grants at a global level poses a risk to services, however suggessting eligibility based on what we know about them would be a better solution.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Service use case</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>A lack of awareness is a key issue for PIP. If someone is applying for a benefit as they have a long term condition or severe disability - if they are getting Universal Credit because they have been deemed not fit for work, that should give us a good indicator [of eligibility for PIP). If they apply for another benefit which isn't PIP - it makes them aware of PIP." DWP</li>
    <li>"There is a lack of understanding and lots of people that applied for PIP already and might want to re-apply" DWP</li>
    <li>"Any exemption form has to be manually checked at the moment, it would be a significant return on investment from a caseworker perspective [if eligibility was known]." MOJ</li>
    <li>"We've got 1 really good use case - LPA120 anyone receving Universal Credit/benefits can get a free subsidised LPA and at the moment you have to prove it with a letter, and if we could offer it without you even having to be aware you're eligible it would be really great." MOJ</li>
