<p>Fixing certain information makes it reliable data that can be re-used. Services felt it was really valuable to have fixed data and felt there could be really positive messaging for the end user "we are so confident in this data that we don't need to update it" Services expect that particular data types should be locked - name, DOB, NI, Photo</p>

<p><b>Expectations</b> - There has to be a mechanism for updating this information. If someone's life has changed and their data is different, it's up to the service to revalidate that. There should be some information you can edit, and the service goes through that process again to validate and create a fixed data point. </p>

<p><b>Time limits</b> - information will be 'locked' for a specified period of time.</p>

<p>However there was concern about the operating model - if the data is wrong somewhere, you have to be able to change it - what is the support mechanism?</p>
<p>If the user contacts the contact centre - who's contact centre is this?</p>
<p>Will the GOV.UK GDS contact centre need to resolve this or the service the data has come from?</p>
<p>How will this be explained to the user?</p>
<p>You could end up getting lots of calls if the data is wrong. </p>
