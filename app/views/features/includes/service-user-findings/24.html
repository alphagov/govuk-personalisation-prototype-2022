<p>Services consistently saw value in this feature - particularly as a mechanism to inform users about renewing something. Services also felt that this feature could also have a positive impact on call volumes - by reminding people in advance that something is expiring, could result in reduced calls from people urgently wanting to renew. "We have a 14% drop off rate" [PIP reference to applicants not completing the application in time]</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"Anytime we contact the citizen they aren't comfortable with a surprise call"</i></p></blockquote>

<p>However, user engagement was a point of concern for services - There needs to be consideration about how we get people to engage with this feature - "I don't know if people would sign up just to be nudged by the government" </p>

<p>There is also some concern about ensuring reminders and the information within them are kept up to date.</p>
