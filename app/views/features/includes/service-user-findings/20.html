<p>This feature was seen as having the potential to be really useful for services across a wide range of use cases.</p>

<p>Services identified that this feature could deliver considerable value by enabling a digital handshake between people - where data can be protected but a transaction can be securely confirmed.</p> 

<p>Several participants commented that not a lot of services have delegated access considered - sharing information with another person's GOV.UK account was seen as being related to this and a welcome step forward - if the user has a carer that needed to access certain information this would allow for this. </p>

<p>However, the key concern that emerged about sharing information with another person's GOV.UK account was about the breakup of households and relationships - user engagement was a concern here around the speed at which people would keep their account information up to date. Safeguarding risks around the breakdown and relationships with domestic abuse featured in the discussions with many services. </p>
