<p>We tested this feature as with a cross government scenario based on our 'childcare' life event. We believe that this feature was understood.</p>

<p>In our scenario, users were asked to consent to use information from their GOV.UK account before autofilling a transactional form. (On a related note, the <a href="13.html">consent prompt</a> before using the data was received well as it builds confidence in how and why data is being used.)</p>

<p>Users then had the opportunity to check answers and edit fields before submitting transactional forms. In line with our design recommendations, users should always have control over final submissions.</p>

<p>Generally autofill was received positively by user research participants:</p>
<br /><br />

<blockquote>

    <p><i>It's autofill but better!" </i></p>
    <p><strong>Phase 1, round 2, participant 1</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>It's easier to enter information once and reuse it across other services" </i></p>
    <p><strong>Phase 1, round 2, participant 3</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Anything that can save time is brilliant. It would take extra time to fill all of that in - so much easier to save and re-use"</i></p>
    <p><strong>Phase 1, round 3, participant 2</strong></p>
