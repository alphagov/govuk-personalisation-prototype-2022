<p>Throughout user research we heard that 'having everything in one place' was useful and valuable.</p>

<p>We tested the concept of adding documents to the GOV.UK account which was met with mixed responses. Whilst some users saw this as useful, others saw it as a potential risk if their account was ever compromised.</p>


<p>It is important to note here that user research is not real life - whilst some users were open to the concept of uploading documents, evaluating this in the safety of the research session is not the same as doing this in real life.</p>

<p>Users expected an area for saved documents could be used in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>a way of proving ID/sharing ID </li>
    <li>a place to save the last three years' residential addresses </li>
    <li>official documents that could 'evidence' a claim </li>
    <li>As a space to upload letters with reference numbers e.g. hospital letters</li>
</ul>

<p>One user envisaged a future scenario where documents automatically appear in this section rather than the user having to upload them.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote class="govuk-!-padding-top-4">

    <p><i>"It would be good if the government could upload your documents then you can add extra"</i> phase 2 round 5</p>

    <p><i>"Official documents are useful, numbers are not."</i>from phase 2, round 1</p>

    <p><i>"This is so much easier than having to go somewhere [to retrieve documents] that's very old fashioned."</i>from phase 2, round 3</p>

    <p><i>"I'm sorry I wouldn't use this. It’s too much."</i></p>

“Good to have everything in one place really. I think it’s handy to have all your documents and things like that because there’s a lot of people who carry stuff around. Like I’ve been in a panic whenever I’ve took my passport out thinking I’m gonna lose it. So if you could get it digitally on a system where like say if I ever needed a DBS check or whatever I could retrieve it from there, that would make me feel a lot less stressed about the process. I like it, I think it’s a good place to have everything, And because it’s an official website as well. A lot of the time you’ve got to send off things haven’t you, like for example if you have a child, you have to send off your child’s birth certificate to claim the child benefit. Whereas if it was an uploaded document onto there then that would cut out a lot of the sending off. Because that’s always a panic if you’re sending off a passport, or if you’re renewing a passport or anything like that, it’s always quite a stressful process I think. Whereas if it was online and you could see the progress of your application like whether it’s been received or anything like that, then that would be a lot easier than you know just kind of waiting around for it to come in the post. Cos it just gets delivered randomly doesn’t it. When you get a passport you don’t get any - it’s not like you can track it or anything like that which is sometimes a bit stressful. So I don’t know, I think it’s a good concept really.”
