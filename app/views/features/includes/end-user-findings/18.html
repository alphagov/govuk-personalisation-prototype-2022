<p>Throughout user research we heard that 'having everything in one place' was useful and valuable.</p>

<p>We tested the concept of adding documents to the GOV.UK account which was met with mixed responses. Whilst some users saw this as useful, others saw it as a potential risk if their account was ever compromised.</p>


<p>It is important to note here that user research is not real life - whilst some users were open to the concept of uploading documents, evaluating this in the safety of the research session is not the same as doing this in real life.</p>

<p>We gathered a variety of insights into how a space to upload documents could be used: - a way of proving ID / sharing ID - a place to save the last three years' residential addresses - official documents which could 'evidence' a claim - letters with reference numbers e.g. hospital letters</p>

<p>Linking end user research to service research led us to define another user need around reducing the burden of supplying proof - in emotive situations, it can be difficult for citizens to provide the relevant documents.</p>

<p>One user envisaged a future scenario where documents automatically appear in this section rather than the user having to upload them.</p>
