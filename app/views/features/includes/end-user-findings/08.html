<p>Some users believe that their data is <a href="https://gov-uk-personalisation.herokuapp.com/user-research/insights#insight-4">shared across all government departments</a>

<p>This finding is not unique to this piece of work. It supports previous research that has taken place within the GOV.UK accounts programme. 

<p>We believe that the current branding and wording of the GOV.UK account confuses users, as they don’t understand the difference between the website and the account. They think they are the same thing which is reflected in their language. 

<p>This may result in end user misunderstandings of the role of the GOV.UK account within cross-gov transactions.  

<p>In later rounds of research, we tested a global push ‘warning’ which explained to users that their data would not automatically be shared across all departments. Whilst this was generally understood, in many cases we had to draw the users’ attention to the content as they did not notice it when scanning the page. We believe that this user expectation cannot be managed by content alone.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote><p>“I’m assuming it would be shared across anything else that comes under GOV.UK. If I use other services across GOV.UK it would be shared across the board.” from phase 1, round 1</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“When I sign up I put my details in with my address details. I would assume that because it already has my address it would link up with my existing claim. Because there are a few things under GOV.UK you can do on their website like tax for the year, housing benefit, because it is all under GOV.UK I’d like to think it would link rather than having to put all the details in again.” from phase 2, round 1. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“I believe it [data] should automatically update. If you’ve made the change electronically there should be nothing stopping it from automatically updating.” from phase 2, round 2</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“I would hope my address would be updated across all services if I changed it.” from phase 2, round 4</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“It’s all stored within the GOV.UK website.” from phase 2 round 3</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“You use one website to access everything.” from phase 1, round 2</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“It [data] will be used across all the different websites to speed up the process.” from phase 2, round 5</p></blockquote>
