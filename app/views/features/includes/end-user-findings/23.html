<p>We used a variety of tags to indicate progress on transactional forms. These included 'in progress' 'complete' and 'urgent'.</p>

<p>In our testing scenarios, we placed these tags within the account area, and within the step-by-step navigation. </p>

<p>There were no remarkable reactions to progress indicators. The progress indicators were understood and received well by users.</p>
