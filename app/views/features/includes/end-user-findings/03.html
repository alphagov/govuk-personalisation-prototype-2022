<p>The purpose of the dashboard was to house features relevant to account management.</p>

<p>The dashboard tested well in user research. Users were able to successfully navigate around the dashboard/account area throughout user research sessions.</p>

<p>As we progressed through <a href="../../../prototypes/">rounds of research</a>, we iterated on the number of pages within this section, and the functionality which could be offered to users with a data rich account.</p>

<p>Offering users ways to manage and control their data was generally understood and well received (see related features).</p>

<p>The dashboard should serve the <a href="../../../user-research/user-needs.html"> user need</a> of understanding how and why their data/attributes are being used in the context of the GOV.UK account. It should be the place where users can easily navigate to and maintain control.</p>
