<p>Not all users were willing to add their personal details to a GOV.UK account. Although some did realise the potential benefit, others expressed that it was unclear why.</p>

<p>A note on the method here  - this is based on our hypothetical concept test in research, we are not seeking to quantify users who would/would not add their data.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>“I don’t think it's useful - I don’t know what it would give me.”</i></p>
  <p><strong>from phase 2, round 3</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>“It would throw me if I was asked this. It's a bit intrusive. Why would you need to know this? I think it should be optional.”</i></p>
  <p><strong>from phase 2, round 3</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote><p><i>“Would only expect to add name, DOB, email address, maybe home address - that should be enough'”</i></p>
  <p><strong>from phase 2, round 3</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote><p><i>“There are definitely advantages to adding personal details  - like like date of birth to make it easier - it's already got your details saved so if you need to apply for anything it's already there saved. In real life, I would invest the time if it was going to save time in the long run.”</i></p>
  <p><strong>from phase 2, round 3</strong></p>
