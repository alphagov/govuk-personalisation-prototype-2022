<p>In phase 2 we tested the concept of saving payment details to the GOV account. As part of a hypothetical recurring transaction, we also tested the idea of managing recurring payments from the GOV account. </p>

<p>The ability to connect details and manage payments received mixed reactions; whilst some users saw this as easy and convenient, others did not feel comfortable connecting financial details to a government account. </p>

<p>Some users commented that it was unclear why payment details would be required.</p>

<p>Users generally expected payment ‘method’ to be bank card details or direct debit. No one in our research sample mentioned Apple or Android pay as preferred methods.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"I would want to keep things like bank and insurers separate - I don't want to cross any wires. I can see the benefit but personally it's something I wouldn't want to do"</i></p>
  <p><strong>Phase 2, round 2, participant 2</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><i>"I'd definitely go for this, I'm super forgetful and have lots of plates spinning so it's one less thing to worry about"</i></p>
  <p><strong>Phase 2, round 2, participant 3</strong></p>
