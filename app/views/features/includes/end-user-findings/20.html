<p>When the concept of sharing was introduced in our prototype, not all users understood what this meant. Some incorrectly thought that the share request (see demo video) was from the service. If further work takes place on this feature, we believe that further content exploration would be required.</p> 

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Example from user research:</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>“If this is just UC then it’s someone from there requesting it.”</i><b>from phase 2, round 4</b></p></blockquote> 

<p>Once users engaged with the shared data task, they appreciated the data controls.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>“There’s nothing here that causes concern. Clear this process has been put in place to protect your information.”</i><b>from phase 2, round 4</b></p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p><i>“It’s good that it reiterates the security aspect.”</i><b>from phase 2, round 4</b></p></blockquote>

 <blockquote> <p><i>“I would like to set the time period I share for, just to be safe.”</i> <b>from phase 2, round 4</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst some users said that hypothetically they would be willing to share information with a partner, this would not be appropriate for people who had separated from a partner. </p>
