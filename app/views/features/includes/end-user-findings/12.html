<p>We created a hypothetical scenario where users could opt to connect their salary and employer details to their GOV.UK account and use this information as part of a cross-government transaction. See <a href="https://gov-uk-personalisation.herokuapp.com/phase-2-round-2">phase 2, round 2</a></p>

<p>Some participants saw the ability to connect external data as a way of making things easier and more accurate. Conversely, others were concerned that if there were inaccuracies in the use of external data, this could impact their benefit claim.</p> 

<p>Examples from user research:</p> 

<blockquote><p><i>"It means the details would be accurate" phase 2, round 2, participant 1</i></p></blockquote> 

<blockquote><p><i>"Definitely a pro because I'm really forgetful, I've got a lot to do. If it's one less thing to do that's perfect." phase 2, round 2, participant 3</i></p></blockquote> 

<blockquote><p><i>"I'd do it manually just in case something changed and I didn't get time to update it...and then it messed up my claim" phase 2. round 2, participant 4</i></p></blockquote> 

<p>This is significant in relation to the user need around 'get everything I am eligible for'. The GOV.UK account should never negatively impact a service transaction, there could be a detrimental impact if benefit claims were affected by errors.</p> 

<p>Employer data was the only data source we auditioned in relation to this feature. Further concept tests with other external data sources could be tested as the programme of work progresses.</p>
