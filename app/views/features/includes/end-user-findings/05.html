<p>In our concept test, it was not initially clear to users what legacy data was, or what it would enable. </p>

<p>The description of legacy data presented a content design challenge. In our prototype we described legacy data as ‘past data’ however this was unclear and therefore further exploration would be needed if work on this feature progresses.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>“What sort of information is this? I don’t know? Maybe it’s previous addresses but I don’t know.” from phase 2, round 3</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>“I don’t understand ‘from the past’. It feels dubious.” from phase 2, round 3</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
    <p>“‘The past’ implies it’s from years ago.” from phase 2, round 3</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
    <p>“Maybe it’s good to review if there was an error in the past.” from phase 2, round 3</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="govuk-!-padding-top-8">The prototype testing flow included a task around ‘connecting’ fictional legacy data and for some, this supported the expectation that data is shared across services via a <a href="08.html"> global push</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>“DWP would know everything anyway?” from phase 2, round 3</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>“I should give consent and it automatically updates everything - that’s the whole point.” from phase 2, round 3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We tested a scenario where the task of connecting fictional legacy data presented a useful outcome. User research participants were notified of an ‘address clash’ and were prompted to review their address so that they did not incur a fine from the DVLA. <a href="../phase-2-round-3"> See phase 2, round 3</a>
</p>

<p>Users understood this as a possible use of legacy data and identified some benefits.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>“The implications are that it would flag to DLVA that your address has changed so they might get on your back a bit. I think that has actually happened to me before! It’s helpful because you might not realise that you might get fined if you don’t tell them.” from phase 2, round 5</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>“This is good - if the info wasn’t linked in the account you could be fined.” from phase 2, round 5"</p>
