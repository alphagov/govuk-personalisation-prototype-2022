<p>First iteration: Users saw the 'verified' tag as relating to identity. We believe that the connection was made between 'verified' and ID because this is a common connotation, but also because users said they think that "they're checking it's me and this is my information".</p> 

<p>However, the purpose of the 'verified' tag was to communicate to the users that a service has checked the data and verified that it is trusted/correct.</p> 

<p><strong>Expectation:</strong> Users expected that 'verified' or 'trusted' data would enable quicker future transactions as the data we hold on them has already been checked for trust and accuracy.</p>
