<p>Our exploration of consent management through user research sessions showed that prospective users <a href="../../../../../user-research/insights#insight-5">appreciate the ability to control and manage their data.</a> </p>
<p>Not all users would consent to save everything, therefore greater control over what information is saved - and used - is preferable.</p>

<p>Some users said that they would not save information that was subject to change. A small number said they would not save their children’s personal information.</p>

So for me, that would probably be what I’d do, just to make it a little bit easier when I come to it, instead of having to delete what’s already in there. But if I was in like a job where I get paid the same amount every week or every month and my hours didn’t change, then I’d be quite happy to save all my details on there for next time.”

</div>

<p>As shown in the image on the left-hand side above, we initially tested an ‘all or nothing consent’. Users in round expressed that they would prefer greater control.</p>



<p><b>Examples from user research:</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“I'd expect a tickbox or option to remove info you don't want to store.”</i></p>
    <p><i>“You could put the little circles next to each one [data list], which pieces you want to save and which you don't.”</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We worked on several iterations which would give the user greater control over their data, as shown in the demo video above, and in the image above right.</p>

<p>The option to consent to save and use at individual data item level was well received. We have confidence in this pattern as it was tested throughout several rounds of research.</p>
<p>Greater control and transparency over data could foster a willingness to engage with the GOV.UK account because we believe it meets user needs:</p>

    <li> <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--turquoise">

<br /><br />
<p>Generally, users reacted positively to the frequency of the consent prompts. Our concept test gave users the option to consent to save new or additional information after each transactional form, as well as the option to consent to use relevant information before transactional forms.</p>


<p><b>Examples from user research:</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“It’s good to be asked every time”</i></p>
    <p><b>From phase 1, round 3</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“It’s good that they are making you aware, good to know what you’re getting into”</i></p>
    <p><b>From phase 1, round 3</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“In the future I would only need to do it [grant consent] one time”</i></p>
    <p><b>From phase 1, round 3</b></p>

<br /><br />
<p>Some users did not fully grasp the concept of saving data to the GOV.UK account and using the data within a service. We believe that this is because <a href="../../../../../user-research/insights#insight-4">users hold a variety of assumptions about how their data is shared by the government</a>. </p>
<p>Further research should seek to explore content iterations to ensure that user consent is informed.</p>

<p>We also tested a way to <a href="21.html">manage data items</a> as part of the dashboard. This was understood by our user research participants.</p>
