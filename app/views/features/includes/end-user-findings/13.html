<p>We tested the concept of consent by asking user research participants to consent when saving information to a fictional GOV.UK account. We also for consent to use information from the account when completing transactional forms.</p>

<p>Not all users would consent to save everything to their GOV.UK account. For example, a small number of participants we spoke to were data sceptics and would not be interested in using the account. </p>

<p>Some said they would be unwilling to save their children's data to their GOV.UK account. There are a variety of things that users would or wouldn't save, however this research does not attempt to define exactly which pieces of information users would save. We cannot ask users to predict their future behaviour. </p>

<p>The control to consent when saving or using information at an individual data item level was received well. Users reacted positively to the fact that they had the option to choose, and that the information was not automatically being saved. This concept was tested in various rounds of research with more than 25 participants, so we have confidence in the pattern used.  </p>

<p>Some users did not fully grasp the concept of saving data to the GOV.UK account and using the data within a service. Further research will be required to ensure that consent is clear and informed.</p>

<p>We also designed a space to 'manage' data items as part of the dashboard which was understood by our user research participants.</p>  

<p>We envisage that asking users for consent every time GOV.UK account data is used is preferable. A global consent for 'always use my data' could be introduced in the future, but this would be subject to consultation with legal stakeholders.</p>

<p>"...the fact that it actually gives you the option to save all of your information, or some of your information, or none at all, I think that's quite good. Because it gives everybody the opportunity then, of their preferences." Phase 1, round 2, participant 3 </p>

<p>"...it's asking for consent every time you add a new piece [of data] it's always asking your permission so that's good." Phase 1, round 1, participant 5  </p>
