<p>Our exploration of consent management through user research sessions showed that prospective users <a href=”https://gov-uk-personalisation.herokuapp.com/user-research/insights”>appreciate the ability to control and manage their data.</a></p>

<p>Not all users would consent to save everything, therefore greater control over what information is saved - and used - is preferable.</p>

<p>Some users said that they would not save information that was subject to change. A small number said they would not save their children’s personal information.</p>

<p>Examples from user research:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>It’s also safeguarding, you know, you don’t know who is looking at those details and how...it’s for me it’s protecting my children and making sure that in the next 1, 5, 10 years they won’t have any issue at all. Because obviously, you know data can be mishandled,  it can fall in the wrong hands it can be misused. I’m mean if it’s my data, I’m an adult I can deal with it, but if it’s their data as the children…”</i></p>
<p><b>From phase 1, round 1</b></p>
 
<blockquote>
    <p><i>“I’d probably save everything apart from childcare costs, average weekly hours worked, and your average weekly pay, but that’s only purely because I work different hours each week, I get paid different each week and my child costs are different each week. So for me, that would probably be what I’d do, just to make it a little bit easier when I come to it, instead of having to delete what’s already in there. But if I was in like a job where I get paid the same amount every week or every month and my hours didn’t change, then I’d be quite happy to save all my details on there for next time.”</i></p>

<p>As shown in the image on the left-hand side above, we initially tested an ‘all or nothing consent’. Users in round expressed that they would prefer greater control. Here are some examples from phase 1, round 1:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“I'd expect a tickbox or option to remove info you don't want to store.”</i></p>
    <p><i>“You could put the little circles next to each one [data list], which pieces you want to save and which you don't.”</i></p>
<blockquote>

<p>We worked on several iterations which would give the user greater control over their data, as shown in the demo video above, and in the image above right.</p>

<p>The option to consent to save and use at individual data item level was well received. We have confidence in this pattern as it was tested throughout several rounds of research. Greater control and transparency over data could foster a willingness to engage with the GOV.UK account because we believe it meets user needs:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Feel safe and secure online</li>
  <li>Feel confident in the way my data is being used</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“Quite a few sites that I’ve used before, they don’t give you the option, they just save everything. So, it’s quite good that they give you the option because, I mean, each person’s different; some people will be happy for all the information to be stored, some people wouldn’t want any information storing at all. So the fact that that actually gives you the option to save all of your information, or some of your information, or none at all, I think that’s quite good. Because it gives everybody the opportunity then, of their preferences.”</i></p>
<p><b>Participant from phase 1, round 2</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>...it's asking for consent every time you add a new piece [of data] it's always asking your permission so that's good."</i></p>
<p><b>Participant from phase 1, round 2 Phase 1, round 1, participant 5</b></p>

<p>Generally, users reacted positively to the frequency of the consent prompts. Our concept test gave users the option to consent to save new or additional information after each transactional form, as well as the option to consent to use relevant information before transactional forms.</p>

<p>Examples from user research:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“It’s good to be asked every time”</i></p>
<p><b>From phase 1, round 3</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“It’s good that they are making you aware, good to know what you’re getting into”</i></p>
<p><b>From phase 1, round 3</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>“In the future I would only need to do it [grant consent] one time”</i></p>
<p><b>From phase 1, round 3</b></p>

<p>Some users did not fully grasp the concept of saving data to the GOV.UK account and using the data within a service. We believe that this is because <a href=”https://gov-uk-personalisation.herokuapp.com/user-research/insights”>users hold a variety of assumptions about how their data is shared by the government<a>.</p>

<p>Further research should seek to explore content iterations to ensure that user consent is informed.</p>

<p>We also tested a way to 'manage' data items as part of the dashboard. This was understood by our user research participants.</p>
