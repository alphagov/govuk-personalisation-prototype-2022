<p>This was not fully tested in user research, however, we did briefly cover the concept of a status tag. As part of <a href="/phase-2-round-4/">phase 2 round 4</a> we tested the concept of <a href="/features/20">shared inforation</a> using a ‘shared’ tag to denote that the data item was being shared with another account holder. </p>

<p>We believe the use of this tag was understood. </p>

<p>Further research around account flags would be beneficial if this feature progresses as part of the programme of work.</p>
