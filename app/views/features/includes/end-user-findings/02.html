<p>User research participants were served links of things they may be interested in based on their past activity (N.B. this was based on an imaginary scenario, not a real-life one). </p>

<p>User reactions to service recommendations were neutral and unremarkable. Some users did not notice the service recommendations until we drew their attention to them. </p>

<p class="govuk-!-padding-top-4">Service recommendations as a concept was outshone by <a href="01.html">Suggested eligibility</a>, which was tested in the same round.</p>

<br />

<p>A note on user research methodology - we cannot evaluate whether or not users would click on suggested links in user research sessions, because the session is based on a hypothetical scenario where there is no genuine task or transaction.</p>
<p>Suggested links could be part of a front-end multi-variate test, however, we would strongly recommend collaboration with legal and policy.</p>
<p>An initial conversation with the legal team suggested that there should be further consideration on the ethics of how links are served - that is, if users miss important information because the service they require is pushed further down a list or page, there could be some liability issues.</p>
