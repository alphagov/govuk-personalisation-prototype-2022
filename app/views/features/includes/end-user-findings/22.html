<p>User testing is limited in what it can tell us about navigation - there is no real-life task or transaction, and therefore the way in which user research participants navigate is influenced by the task we give them.</p>

<p>We did, however, gather some insights around navigation.</p>

<p>In our first round of testing, we used <ahref="https://www.gov.uk/get-childcare" target="_blank">'Get Childcare: step by step'</a>. Research participants commented that there was a lot of information and we observed some users getting lost. In subsequent rounds, we opted to use a stripped-back version of the step-by-step.</p>

<p>A relevant finding through our work on <a href="/features/04">curated content</a> suggests that users will use curated information on the page to quickly scan for the information they need.</p>
