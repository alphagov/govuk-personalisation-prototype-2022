<p>Throughout the user research sessions, users were able to easily navigate to the account, and subsequently to settings. Users were able to toggle on and off to configure the settings.</p>
 
<p>We received a variety of views around how users would interact with these settings; some commented that they would switch them all on, others had certain preferences for configuration.</p>
 
<p>The concept of settings was understood, however, there were some elements of content that were unclear to some users. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples from user research:</h3>

<blockquote><p>"Pretty straightforward, easy to change, turn on and off" phase 2, round 2, participant 3</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I don't need recommendations. Would it inundate me?" phase 2, round 1, participant 3</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“I don’t understand what ‘make dates, locations and amounts relevant to me’ means” phase 2, round 5, participant 3</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I'd also want to see something - a policy - on how my information is used and how it's shared. A breakdown on how it's used, won't be shared with third parties...you want your information to be protected." phase 2, round 1, participant 4</p></blockquote> 

<p>Further content exploration around the management of settings would be needed as the programme of work progresses.</p>
