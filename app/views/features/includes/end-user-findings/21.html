<p>In our various rounds of user testing, we included UI options for data management so that we could engage users in discussion around how they would expect to manage their data. This was primarily in the dashboard/account section.</p>

<p>Users were familiar with standard terms such as 'change' and 'delete' although we would recommend continued exploration of how users perceive and comprehend the impact of any changes or deleted data. For example, global push and the impact on data they have entered as part of a service transaction.</p>

<p>We also included an option to 'change' data as part of the 'check your answers' page. We have confidence in this pattern as it is used widely across the GOV.UK Design System.</p>

<p>There was less familiarity with data management options such as <a href="/features/17">Audit log</a>, <a href="/features/20"> Shared Information</a> and <a href="/features/12">Send/revoke with external data source</a>, although we were still able to explore perceptions and expectations through concept testing. </p>

<p>Further detail on each type is detailed on the respective features pages.</p>
