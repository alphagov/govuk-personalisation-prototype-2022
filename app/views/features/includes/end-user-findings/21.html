<p>In our various rounds of user testing, we included UI options for data management so that we could engage users in discussion around how they would expect to manage their data.  This was primarily in the dashboard/account section.</p>

<p>Users were familiar with standard terms such as 'change' and 'delete' although we would recommend continued exploration of how users perceive and comprehend the impact of any changes or deleted data. For example, global push and the impact on data they have entered as part of a service transaction.</p> 

<p>We also included an option to 'change' data as part of the 'check your answers' page. We have confidence in this pattern as it is used widely across the GOV.UK Design System.</p>

<p>The key learning regarding management of data items is that the dashboard should be built with future scalability in mind. There will no doubt be states or types of data we have not yet considered, and users should be given the ability to control how their data is used.</p>
