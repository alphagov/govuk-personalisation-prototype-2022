<p class="govuk-!-padding-top-8">Some users were uncomfortable about their child’s information being displayed in-page. Although this work did not uncover any common pieces of data that were too intrusive to use as part of curated content, this should be considered as the programme of work progresses.</p>
<p> We acknowledge that across a diverse user audience, different people will have different tipping points around what they perceive as intrusive.
