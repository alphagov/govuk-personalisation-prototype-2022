<p>We engaged users in discussion around reasons for deleting their data, and what the impact of deleting their data would be.</p>

<p>Some users commented that they would delete data if they felt the security of their account had been compromised. In this way, 'delete data' is perceived as a security function.</p>

<p>Some users believed that if they deleted their data they would have to 'start from scratch'.</p>

<p>There may be some confusion around deleting data from a GOV.UK account vs. the perception that service data has been deleted.</p>

<p>This feature would benefit from further user research to explore the impact of deleting data and what that means for data submitted to various services.</p>
