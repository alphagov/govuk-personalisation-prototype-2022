<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Risks:</h3>
<p>There could be a fraud/hacking risk to the end user if everything is in one place. This came through as a concern in user research.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Considerations:</h3>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>Should the user be able to add documents to an account themselves, or should this be a space for services to add transactional documents?</li>
  <li>If users have the ability to upload documents, should there be any restrictions on the type of document or file size?</li>
  <li>Saving and uploading may only be adopted by those who are digitally competent</li>
  <li>This piece would require further work in defining role-based access i.e. who from a service should be able to access these documents</li>
  <li>Not everyone would want a digital document saved to their account - it is crucial that other approaches and ethics of this piece are considered</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Whilst we have found in user research that 'everything in one place' would be useful and valuable, this should not automatically be defined as a place to upload documents or a personal data store. There could be other technical solutions that better serve this need.</b></p>
