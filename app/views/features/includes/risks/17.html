<p> Initially, we anticipte that an acount audit log may be limited to account activity only (i.e. it wont cover how the data is used within a service's internal systems). This must be considered in line with user expectations and may require some further research depending on what the audit trail MVP looks like.</p>

<p>Related features also have to be taken into consideration. Users should be given the ability to <a href="11.html"> delete data</a> and therefore, further work should be done to understand whether users can still view past usage of data that has been deleted. This will require user testing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the ability to <a href="20.html"> share data between account holders</a> is introduced in the future how would the audit trail represent data which is no longer shared. Again, this is a consideration for the future and will need to be tested to support discussions around MVP.</p>

<p>In terms of rules for the audit trail, the following should be considered: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>how much data is pulled back</li>
    <li>how long are audit trails retained for</li>
    <li>what data range would be applicable</li>

</ul>
