<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Consent to autofill</h3>

<p>Autofilling forms is one of the first steps towards automating transactions. Transactions should always be the user's decision, as the data would be shared with another controller.</p>

<p>For this reason we expect that consent will always be needed for autofilling forms and automated transactions. Automating without consent will be highly unlikely from a both policy and design perspective.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-8">Form routing:</h3>

<p><b>If we autofill and autosubmit answers, how does this affect the logic routing in the form?</b></p>

<p>For example:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>A user has their DOB (01/01/1960) saved to their account</li>
        <li>'Question A' on a form asks for the user's DOB</li>
        <li>The form's logic means if a user's DOB is before 01/01/1970, the user will get presented 'question B', whilst those born after that date get 'question C'.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If 'question A' is autocompleted and not shown to the user, does this routing stop working?</p>

    <br />

    <p><b>Does the account need to understand the routing ahead of time to accurately present the consent request before the form begins?</b></p>

    <p> Using the above form/logic example, if the user happens to have answers for questions A, B and C saved to their account, how could/should the data-item level consent to autofill be presented?</p>
    <p>To only request consent for the questions this user will be asked (as opposed to for all questions this form <i>might</i> ask), the account would need to calculate that based on the answer to 'question A' it would be autofilling, consent is only required for the data item that it will use for 'question B'. </p>
