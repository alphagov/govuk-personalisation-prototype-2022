<p>Autofilling forms is one of the first steps towards automating transactions. Transactions should always be the user's decision, as the data would be shared with another controller.</p>

<p>For this reason we expect that consent will always be needed for autofilling forms and automated transactions. Automating without consent will be highly unlikely from a both policy and design perspective.</p>

<p>If we autofill certain elements and 'hide' these items, does it potentially stop a 'routing' when a service goes down?</p>

<p>For example, a user fills in their DOB. If their DOB is before 01/01/1970, the user will get presented with new options. If this is pre-populated, does this functionality stop working? </p>
