<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Considerations:</h3>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>If transactional progress is displayed in relation to a service, this must be served accurately</li>
    <li>We used tags in our concept exploration, however, progress indication is not necessarily limited to that; there may be other design options that serve this need</li>
    <li>Timescales for progress updates from a service should be agreed upon and managed so that the user receives progress indications in line with their expectations</li>
</ul>

<p>We took the decision to place progress indicators on transactional forms only, not information pages. Our rationale for this is that we have no way of measuring whether or not the end user has read and comprehended information pages.</p> 

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Accessed Services Statuses:</h3>
<p>How much data do we pull back, (are there SLAs?) and how does a service update the status of the current "in-flight status" of a service. Do we have to store contact details centrally for services?</p>
