<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Design</h3>

<p>The dashboard, like all other features and scenarios covered in our research, was designed in accordance with <a href="https://gov-uk-personalisation.herokuapp.com/user-research/approach" class="govuk-link">these assumptions</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout our rounds of user research, we tested a number of features which would sit within a dashboard / account area.</p>

<p>For the most part, we leveraged <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/" target="_blank">existing patterns</a>, deviating only to serve the research and questions we were trying to answer. The detailed design and iteration of new patterns wasnâ€™t the priority of our research.</p>

<p> We did, however, start to consider how a feature will react when the account (and data within it) gets significantly larger...</p>


<h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-8">Future design considerations</h4>

<p>The GOV.UK account will be the biggest change to GOV.UK since its launch.</p>

<p>In time, every page / department / service will be affected by the account and its features. This will create a set of new design challenges which will stretch the current design system.</p>

<div class="govuk-warning-text">

    <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
        New patterns and components will inevitably be required

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-8">Scalability challengs</h4>

<p>Our research has enabled us to highlight design and performance scalability challenges, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    <li>How will the dashboard UI tolerate lots of features, and lots of data being saved to the account? </li>
    <li>Is the feature still clear and simple to operate? Does it still meet the user needs, such as saving time and reducing cognitive load?</li>
    <li>How does the account pull back and store 100+ data items? What are the performance impact and challenges?</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-8">Ownership</h3>

<p>Much like homepages and navigations - dashboards can become unwieldy without proper control.</p>
<p>We believe there will be ownership challenges with the dashboard, with multiple teams having ownership stakes in various components used across the account space.</p>

<p><b>Clear ownership and recognised, appropriate design patterns will need to be established, to ensure coherency and consistency.</b> </p>
