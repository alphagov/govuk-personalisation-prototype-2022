<p>The dashboard, like all other features and scenarios covered in our research, was designed in accordance with <a href="https://gov-uk-personalisation.herokuapp.com/user-research/approach" class="govuk-link">govuk-linkthese assumptions</a>.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK account will be the biggest change to GOV.UK since its launch.</p>

<p>In time, every page, every department and every service will be affected by the account and its features. This will create a set of new design challenges which will stretch the current design system. New patterns and components will inevitably be required. </p>

<p>For the most part, our prototyping has leveraged existing patterns, deviating only to serve the research and questions we were trying to answer. Identifying the need of real detailed design and the iteration of new patterns wasnâ€™t the priority of our research.</p>

<p>Throughout our rounds of user research we tested a number of features which would sit within a dashboard. We also started to consider how a feature will react when the account (and data within it) gets significantly larger.</p>

<p>Our research has enabled us to highlight design challenges, such as:</p> 
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>Is the feature still clear and simple to operate?</li>
   <li>How will the UI tolerate this? </li>
</ul>

<p>We believe there will be ownership challenges of the dashboard. Much like homepages and navigations - dashboards can become unwieldy without proper control. Clear ownership and recognised design patterns will need to be established. </p>
