<p>The content and UI we used in user research were created by us to explore the concept. We expect this may change once legal and policy become stakeholders.</p>

<p>In later iterations the pattern we tested enabled users to have control over their data on an individual data item level. Understanding the feasibility of this is dependent on technical analysis.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How are permissions presented to users?</h3>

<p>Potentially, users could allow just one piece of data to be accessed by a single service. Displaying the data permissions would be extremely complex.</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Do users really want this level of detail?</li>
    <li>Are we creating unnecessary complexity rather than grouping specific data attributes?</li>
</ul>
