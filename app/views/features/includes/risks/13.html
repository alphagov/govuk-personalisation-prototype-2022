<p>The content and UI we used in user research were created by us to explore the concept. We expect this may change once legal and policy become stakeholders.</p>

<p>In later iterations the pattern we tested enabled users to have control over their data on an individual data item level. Understanding the feasibility of this is dependent on technical analysis.  </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Granular levels of control:</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>How are permissions presented to users? </li>
</ul>

<p>Potentially, users could allow just one piece of data to be accessed by a single service. Displaying the data permissions would be extremely complex.</p>

<p>Do users really want this level of detail? Are we creating unnecessary complexity rather than grouping specific data attributes?</p>
