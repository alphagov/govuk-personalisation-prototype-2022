<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Considerations:</h3>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Fixing data gives the impression that personal data does not belong to the person</li>
  <li>Users perception of global push and how we would manage their expectations/understanding of how it works</li>
  <li>You would need a mechanism/process for the user to change fixed data if it's incorrect</li>
  <li>If data is fixed and it's incorrect, it could delay users from updating something/accessing a service</li>
  <li>Data would need to be verified and locked until a certain date. What happens at expiry/when this date is reached?</li>
  
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Risk:</h3>

<p>Would need to be careful that data designated as fixed may change in future "Be careful in future as things like gender may not be fixed"</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Data:</h3>
<p>Services assumed that in order for data to become fixed it would have to be verified first.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Operating model</h3>
<p>There was concern from services about the operating model - if the data is wrong somewhere, you have to be able to change it - what is the support mechanism? If the user contacts the contact centre - who's contact centre is this? Will the GOV.UK GDS contact centre need to resolve this or the service the data has come from? How will this be explained to the user?</p>
