<p>We believe that users could rely on notifcations for updates. Therefore they should be accurate and timely.</p>

<p>If notifications are inaccurate, or delayed, then there could be a negative user impact. This is of particular concern in the case of benefit claimants.</p>

<p>We believe that users should have control over notifications, and have the ability to manage these, both for the GOV.UK account and for the individual service. This should be clear in the account area and we would recommend further user testing around this.</p>

<p> There should be careful consideration that notifications do not become overwhelming if they are all coming from a central service.</p>

<p>Service research with the MOJ raised the concern that "depending on what the service is, the notification could become noise for the user."</p>
