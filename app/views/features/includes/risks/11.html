<p>A challenge may be presented in the link between the audit log and 'delete data'.</p>

<p>For example, would an audit log allow users to view deleted items and how they had previously been used? Or, would 'delete' remove the record entirely?</p>

<p>These concepts have not been tested with users so we would recommend further scenario mapping and user testing here.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">True data deletion:</h3>

<p>If a user deletes their contact details and a service *only* uses the PDS, then the service has no way to contact the user. Then what happens?</p>  

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Data restore:</h3>

<p>If this is a personal data store, there is no responsibility for anyone to backup this data.  If it is corrupted or deleted - what happens? </br>
Is there a temporary rollback?  Whose responsibility is it to do this?  (for example, any data stored on a user's phone is *their* responsibility to backup - is this the same with the PDS?) </p> 

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Does delete mean delete:</h3>

<p>If a user deletes their data on their PDS, this data will still exist on a service.  Whose responsibility is it to push this through - if anyone's?  Should services rely on their own data outside of a transaction?</p>
