<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Risks</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>Red flag with domestic abuse - needs to have safeguards to ensure the account is not compromised</li>
   <li>The obvious one is the creation and breakup of households, users would need to be able to quickly tell us they're setting up or breaking up a relationship</li>
   <li>The speed with which people would keep that up to date</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Policy considerations:</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Adequate security controls will need to be put in place (for example use of 2-factor authentication) in order to prevent abuse of data/fraud, data being used in the wrong way or shared with the wrong person</li>
  <li>As users will be given the choice as to whether or not they share their information with another account it isn't a huge concern</li>
  <li>Consideration needs to be taken into data items and level of data that can and can't be shared with another account</li>
</ul>
