<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Accuracy of data, users scan the information very quickly and miss incorrect data</li>
    <li>The risk of making bad recommendations through curated content using incomplete data</li>
    <li>GOV.UK becoming solely responsible - 'You didn't tell me'</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Policy considerations</h3>


<p>Are there types of data that are too sensitive to be used for curated content, where the risk outweighs the benefits?</p>
