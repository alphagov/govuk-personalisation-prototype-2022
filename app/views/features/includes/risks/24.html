<p>If users rely on reminders, the liability and responsibility for accuracy and timeliness need to be agreed upon. This is crucial because if users rely on reminders to complete tasks, there could be a human impact if reminders are not served correctly. e.g. there could be an impact on someone's benefit payment.</p> 

<p>Users should have control over reminders and have the ability to tailor them or switch them off according to their own personal preferences and needs.</p>

<p>Service owner research raised a consideration about onboarding and engagement. </p>

<p>HMRC have done some recent research:</p>
  
<blockquote><p><i>"we've done some UR with half dozen young people - 50/50 said yeah they'd be fine with it, the other half said absolutely not. a lot of the people you'd expect to be engaged just didn't want to do it."</i></p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Responsibility:</h3>

<p>Whose responsibility is it to notify the users to do something?  The service has the majority of the information required to determine if something needs doing, and what exactly needs doing - a PDS would have none of this information available.  </p>

<p>However - the PDS could be used as a way of contacting the person and could offer a centralised service to contact people and preferences rather than a service holding this specific information.</p>
