        <li>Data accuracy is a risk and needs to be verified/trusted before it gets pulled into a user's account. Account data is used to prepopulate when applying for services and can be shared across services and other accounts.</li>
        <li>Will people be comfortable with how much information some departments have about them - they will either be pleased or mortified.</li>
        <li>Some data will only ever be specific to a given service</li>
        <li>Over time, this could build up a huge repository of data which could present a security risk. </li>
        <li>Be careful that you only playback info that is useful to the service. e.g. if you were on UC then you wouldn't want the data shared in Defra. Security would be really important with this feature.</li>

        <li>What are the purpose limitations? </li>
        <li>Security controls, the more data that is used within a centralised more creates a higher security risk</li>
        <li>Consideration will need to be taken into account for data that is particularly sensitive and whether or not it is appropriate for personalisation, for this reason, users should be given the choice about whether or different types of data gets shared with services</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-8">Design and content considerations </h3>

    <p>Any future design iterations should explore the challenge of how to explain and convey the purpose of legacy data. </p>
