<p>As a future consideration, any management controls will need to tolerate the potential for data rich accounts. There will likely be a future design challenge around how to display, group and organise larger data sets.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What data can be maintained:</h3>

<p>A user can access and maintain unverified data - but they should not be able to maintain "verified credentials".<p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Alter verified data:</h3>

<p>If a user wants to alter/update verified data - how do they do this?  How do they know which services they need to go back through to alter this?<p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Change of "key" verified data:</h3> 

<p>If a user alters a key verified data element (such as DOB), should this cause *all* verified credentials to become invalid?<p>
