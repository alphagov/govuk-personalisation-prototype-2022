<p>Once users have signed into their GOV.UK account they'll be able to see their dashboard / account area.</p>

<p>In the short-term, this will allow them to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <a href="21.html">view and manage their data</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="17.html">view recent account activity</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        manage their account details - such as their email address and password
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, the demands of the dashboard will increase once new features are introduced, warranting more controls and functionality.</p>
