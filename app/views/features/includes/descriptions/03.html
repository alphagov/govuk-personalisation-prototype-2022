<p>Once users have signed into their GOV.UK account they'll be able to see their dashboard. In the short-term this will allow them to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    view and manage their data
  </li>
  <li>
   view recent account activity
  </li>
  <li>
   manage their account details - such as their email address and password
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, the demands of the dashboard will increase once new features are introduced, warranting more controls and functionality.</p>
