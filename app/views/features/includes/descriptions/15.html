<p>Whenever a user starts a new form or application they will be asked if they want to use data saved in their GOV.UK account to prefill any answers the service will need. The user will always have the opportunity to amend any prefilled information before submitting the form.</p>

<p>Not only will this save the user time, but it will also reduce the risk of error if they were to input it over and over as normal. As the level of data saved in the account increases, there should be less need for the user to provide information. Eventually the user may be in the position to submit fully prefilled forms.</p>
