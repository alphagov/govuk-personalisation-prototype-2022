    <p>To fully support the features we’ve been testing with users and services in phase 2, services need the following capabilities in place:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>To have a digital front end path for customers</li>
        <li>To seamlessly load service application data into their backend systems</li>
        <li>To share information digitally with their users</li>
        <li>For this information to be stored in structured and consistent formats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We engaged with services to understand their data and process gaps against their capabilities.</p>

    <p>Most of the services we spoke to are either planning, supporting or currently undergoing a digital transformation.</p>
    <p>These include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-padding-bottom-4 govuk-!-padding-top-2">
        <li>Paper to digital frontend</li>
        <li>Paper to digital backend</li>
        <li>In-person to virtual services</li>
        <li>Siloed digital services to single sign-on (SSO) - also known as ‘one stop shop’</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many services are trying to move away from their current paper applications, which must be manually inputted into systems and not digitised at all.</p>
    <p>The HRMC Ops team for Child Benefit receives 700,000 paper applications per year.</p>

    <p>Some services that appear digital to users, may have manual backend processes.</p>

    <p>We’ve used data models to show the difference between services As-Is processes and how they could be supported by GOV.UK account features.</p>
    <p>The research used a small number of services so should not be taken as a full representation of all government services.</p>

    <p>The data models that include potential GOV.UK account features are indicative of what might be possible and do not represent an implementation roadmap at this time.</p>

        <li><b>Broken data-flows</b> - PDF applications or digital frontend applications that must be printed and posted into the service.</li>
        <li><b>Low visibility for the user</b> - an application status is often captured and regularly updated in backend systems, but services may be unable to share this information with the user.</li>
        <li><b>Manual verification</b> - services spend a significant amount of time validating the information users provide in their applications, often via telephone, post or manual system search. Some services do not verify the identity of applicants or involved parties.</li>

        <li><b>Notifying non-account holders</b> - service journeys may have people involved who aren’t involved in the application but who need to be notified, for example if there are people to notify in a Lasting Power of Attorney.</li>
