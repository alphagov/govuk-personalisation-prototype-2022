            You could get <b>£3,120</b> a year towards your childcare costs.
        </div> <!-- /. inset-text -->

        <p>You can get up to £2,000 a year towards your childcare costs for each child aged 11 or under, or up to £4,000 a year for each child aged 16 or under if they are disabled. You get a £2 government top-up for every £8 you pay in childcare.</p>

                <p>You can use it to pay for up to £10,000 of childcare for each child a year – so you’d get up to £2,000 in top-ups a year, or £4,000 a year if they are disabled.</p>

                <p>The child or children must usually live with you. They stop being eligible on 1 September after their 11th birthday.</p>
