<p>This was not fully explored in our piece of work due to the limitations of user testing. We canâ€™t prove or disprove whether a personalised navigation would work in a user testing session because there is no real life task for the user. </p>

<p>We recommend further alignment with the Whole User Journeys team, and the Step by Step journeys team. </p>

<p>This piece could be explored with multivariate testing where possible, as this is likely to give a clearer picture of optimised task completion. Usability testing sessions are highly influenced by the prototype flow. </p>
